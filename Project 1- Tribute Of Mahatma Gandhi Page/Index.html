          <h2>Indian Freedom Fighter</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (ISO: Mohanadasa Karamacamda Gandhi; 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) 
                was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist 
                who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule.
                He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. 
                The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.

                Gandhi dedicated his life to discovering and pursuing truth, or Satya, and called his movement satyagraha.
            </li>
            <li>
                The first formulation of the satyagraha as a political movement and principle occurred in 1920, 
                which Gandhi tabled as "Resolution on Non-cooperation" in September that year before a session of the Indian Congress.
            </li>
            <li>
                It was the satyagraha formulation and step, states Dennis Dalton, 
                that deeply resonated with beliefs and culture of his people, 
                embedded him into the popular consciousness, transforming him quickly into Mahatma
            </li>
            <li>
                Gandhi stated that the most important battle to fight was overcoming his own demons, fears, and insecurities. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Gandhi summarised his beliefs first when he said, "God is Truth."
                Gandhi would later change this statement to "Truth is God." Thus, satya (truth) in Gandhi's philosophy is "God".
